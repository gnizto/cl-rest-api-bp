# Code Learning: REST API Best Practices

Applying the concepts presented on the Free Code Camp tutorial called [REST API Design Best Practices Handbook ‚Äì How to Build a REST API with JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-api-design-best-practices-build-a-rest-api/) written by **Jean-Marc M√∂ckel**.

## üìã Objective

The main objective is to build the idea of the best practices while creating an REST API, applying those conceptions and conventions to a realistic project called "Crossfit WOP (**W**orkouts **o**f the **D**ay).

It is important to remember that in a real project is important to follow the conceptions and conventions focusing on the best practices, but it's essential to remember that the user experience, security and performance should not be forget.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running The API

Enter the **crossfit-wod-api** folder:

```bash
cd crossfit-wod-api
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i -Y
```

Run the API:

```bash
npm run dev
```
